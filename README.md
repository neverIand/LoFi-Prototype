<h1>LoFi-Prototype</h1>
<p>Assignment 1 for Human-Computer Interaction Extended (06 30251). The HiFi prototype is included as well and is displayed as default.</p>

<p>Our group did not have enough time to get hands on those online tools and I don't really like them anyway, so I wrote it on my own. Every interface was designed by other group members aside from the calendar view, and I just implemented them using HTML.</p>

<p>The code is quite a mess since we had to frequently iterate the design, and that means my primary goal was to make it looks like intended. Therefore, I did not have too much time to refactor the code, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Live Server is preferred to view the interface while you can do it by open each file directly as well.</p>
